👋 Hi! My name is Aishwarya Balaji. I am a BS Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin.

🔭 I’m currently working to develop a full-stack website for my volunteering organization, Gift of Words. The
  goal of my organization is to bridge the education gap created by the pandemic, and I would like to connect my 
  interests in Community Service and Technology by learning full-stack development.

🤝 I would love to collaborate on new projects! Please feel free to reach out to me at aishwarya.balajic@gmail.com
